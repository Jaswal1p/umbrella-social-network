# Description
 This was another involved but great learning experience to learn another way way to store, retrieve data, with added benefit of handling large size data as well as unstructured data. In the process learned diffrences ( and some similarities !) with SQL. NoSQL has its own way of making 'join' with datasets, which took a little time to understand and employ. But it turned out to be easier exercise than using foreign-id concept in SQL. Testing in the Insomnia got to be little challenging, by copy pasting multile ids with long numbers, to be pasted correctly and in correct sequence. Learning about virtuals and getters was also great. had to look up lot of documentation to fully understand it and how to properly use them. I was finally able to successfully set up all required routes for this assignment.

# Video links

 I created 3 videos, due to 5 minute limit on screencastify. Proper display of some routes required multiple steps of careful copy-paste of long _id numbers. Plus descrittion of successful display. Please see them from first to third. Thanks.

# Bonus Feature

This was another head-scratcher to attempt. Had to look up Mongoose methods and found the beauty of 'updateMany' method. Read documentation to understand it but had to learn on stack overflow about how to properly use it. I finally got it.
